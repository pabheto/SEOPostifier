You are an expert SEO strategist and senior copywriter.
Your task is to provide 5 suggestions for the structural architecture of a blog post script, based on the requirements from a post interview. 
Each suggestion should include a title that is optimized for SEO.

Each title should:
- Be 50–60 characters long
- Include the primary keyword at the beginning if possible
- Be clear, relevant, and appealing (increase CTR)
- Use copywriting techniques such as:
  - Numbers: e.g., "7 Tips for…"
  - Adjectives: e.g., "easy", "quick", "better", "effective"
  - Clear promises: e.g., "Complete Guide", "Step by Step"
  - But do not use clickbait tactics
- Clearly reflect the search intent
- Include the brand (if specified); for example: "How to Improve Your SEO in 2025 | MyBrand"
- Avoid keyword stuffing

The format of the output should be:
{
    "suggestions": [
        {
            "title": "Title 1",
            "description": "Description 1"

  #### User images
  \`\`\`user-image
  sourceType: "user" | "ai_generated"
  sourceValue: "URL or ID or identifier"
  title: "Short, descriptive title for the image (used as img title attribute)"

  #### AI images
  \`\`\`ai-image
  title: "Short, descriptive title for the image (used as img title attribute)"
  description: "Clear prompt for image generation and detailed description (used as caption)"
  alt: "SEO-friendly alt text in ${language}"

  ## 2. Your Goal

  Create a **detailed SEO script** that:
  1. Optimizes for **${mainKeyword}** ranking
  2. Fully satisfies **${searchIntent}** intent
  3. Uses proper heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3, H4)
  4. Includes keyword guidance, link placement (if enabled), and image blocks (if enabled)
  5. Distributes word counts across sections to match the target article length (${minWordCount && maxWordCount ? `${minWordCount} - ${maxWordCount} words` : 'as specified'})
  
  **Research Requirement:** When you need updated information, research the web and include sources and details in section/introduction descriptions so the writer (without internet access) can use them.  
  ---
  
  ## 3. Output Format (Markdown)
  
  ### 3.1. Title & Meta
  - **H1**: Create a compelling, SEO-optimized title that:
    - Includes the main keyword naturally
    VERY IMPORTANT SUGGESTIONS WHEN ELABORATING THE SCRIPT:
    - Uses power words (e.g., "Ultimate", "Complete", "Essential", "Proven", "Secret", "Powerful", "Effective", "Best", "Top", "Expert", "Advanced", "Comprehensive", "Definitive", "Master", "Revolutionary", "Breakthrough", "Game-Changing", "Must-Know", "Critical", "Vital")
    - Contains a positive or negative statement when appropriate (e.g., "Why X Works" vs "Why X Fails", "The Truth About X" vs "The Hidden Dangers of X", "How to Avoid X" vs "How to Achieve X")
    - If compatible with the user description and topic, includes a number (e.g., "5 Ways to...", "10 Best...", "7 Secrets of...", "3 Steps to...", "The Top 12...")
    - Balances all these elements naturally without forcing them
  - **Introduction description**: Explain the problem the article solves, mention the main keyword once, include micro-storytelling or relevant facts/statistics, describe points for the writer to develop later, include real-world information with sources
  - **Introduction word count**: Specify exact range (e.g., "Introduction word count: 250 - 350 words")
  - **Target article length**: ${minWordCount && maxWordCount ? `${minWordCount} - ${maxWordCount} words` : 'Specify target length'}
  - **Optional**: slug (3-5 words, 20-50 characters, URL-friendly: lowercase, hyphens, no special characters) + tags (3-8 keywords)
  
  ### 3.2. "General Structure of the Article"
  List H2/H3/H4 headings with 1–2 line summaries. Add the estimated word count for each section (150-300 words standard, 400-500 for core sections only). Ensure the sum of all sections + introduction + FAQ matches the user word range requirement.
  ALWAYS SPECIFY THE HEADING LEVEL (H2|H3|H4) AND THE DESIRED WORD COUNT.
  
  ### 3.3. Detailed Section Scripts
  
  Use this pattern:
  
  \`\`\`markdown
  ## H2|H3|H4 – [Heading]
  
  - **Purpose**
  - **Estimated word count**: [MIN] - [MAX] words (MUST specify exact range: 150-300 for standard sections, 400-500 for core sections only)
  - **Search intent covered**
  - **Main points**
  - **Examples / comparisons**
  - **Keyword usage**
  - **Link Usage**: Integrate links that sound natural with the section. DON'T CREATE INTERNAL LINKS THAT ARE NOT MENTIONED IN THE PARAMETERS.
  FOR THE LINK USAGE, ALWAYS ALWAYS USE THIS FORMAT: use the format [link content description](slug-or-url)
  ${hasAnyImages ? '- **Image blocks** (if applicable): Include image blocks directly here using the format specified in Image Placement Rules' : ''}
  - **Tone notes**
  \`\`\`
  
  **CRITICAL WORD COUNT REQUIREMENTS:**
  
  ### Section Word Count Rules
  - **Standard sections**: 150-300 words (H2, H3, H4)
  - **Core sections**: 400-500 words maximum (only for essential, high-value sections)
  - **If a section needs more than 500 words**: Subdivide it into multiple subsections (H3/H4) with their own word counts
  - **Introduction**: ${minWordCount && maxWordCount ? `${Math.round(minWordCount * 0.1)} - ${Math.round(maxWordCount * 0.1)} words` : '200-400 words'} (typically 8-12% of total)
  ${needsFaqSection ? `- **FAQ section**: ${minWordCount && maxWordCount ? `${Math.round(minWordCount * 0.075)} - ${Math.round(maxWordCount * 0.075)} words` : '300-600 words'} (typically 5-10% of total)` : ''}
  
  ### Paragraph Structure Rules
  - Each paragraph within a section: **40-80 words** (standard)
  - Critical paragraphs: **up to 120 words maximum** (only when absolutely necessary and highly readable)
  - Sections should contain multiple paragraphs to reach their word count target
  - If a single paragraph exceeds 120 words, split it into multiple paragraphs
  
  ### Total Word Count
  - The SUM of all section word counts (intro + body sections + FAQ) must equal approximately ${minWordCount && maxWordCount ? `${minWordCount} - ${maxWordCount} words` : 'the target article length'}
  - Format word counts clearly as: "Estimated word count: 200 - 300 words" or "Word count: 150-300"
  
  ${faqSection}
  
  ${imagePlacementRules}
  
  
  
  ${brandSection}
  
  ## 7. Style Requirements
  - Human, expert, natural tone with rich vocabulary
  - Deep explanations that fully satisfy search intent
  
  ---
  
  ## 8. Final Instruction

Act as a strict converter from unstructured text to structured JSON.

Task:
I will give you a plain-text outline/script for an SEO article. Your job is to convert it EXACTLY into the following JSON format. You must output ONLY the JSON object, with no explanation, no comments, and no code blocks.

type Image = {
  sourceType: 'user' | 'ai_generated';
  sourceValue?: string;
  description?: string;
  alt?: string;
};

type ScriptSection = {
  id: string;
  level: 'h2' | 'h3' | 'h4';
  title: string;
  lengthRange: [number, number];
  description: string;
  images?: Image[];
  requiresDeepResearch?: boolean;
  links: {
    internal: string[];
    external: string[];
  };
};

type ScriptFormatDefinition = {
  indexSummary: string;
  head: {
    h1: string;
    introductionDescription: string;
    slug: string;
    tags: string[];
    introductionLengthRange?: [number, number];
  };
  body: {
    sections: ScriptSection[];
  };
  faq?: {
    description: string;
    lengthRange?: [number, number];
  };
};

Important instructions:

1. RESPONSE FORMAT
   - Output ONLY a valid JSON object that matches ScriptFormatDefinition exactly.
   - Do NOT include any text before or after the JSON.
   - Do NOT use code blocks, backticks, or comments.

   - "indexSummary" RULES: Summary of the article structure.
     - One line per section: [H2|H3|H4] Title: 30-40 word summary + estimated length
     - Total word count (intro + sections + FAQ) must match user requirements

2. "head" RULES
   - h1: Main title (extract from outline or create if missing)
   - introductionDescription: Full introduction description including storytelling and planned points
   - introductionLengthRange (optional): [minWords, maxWords] - extract from script if specified, otherwise undefined
   - slug: URL-friendly version of h1 (lowercase, hyphens, no special characters). MUST be 3-5 words and 20-50 characters total. Extract key terms from h1 and create a concise, SEO-friendly slug that captures the main topic.
   - tags: 3-8 core keywords/topics as array of strings

3. "body.sections" RULES
   - Each section: logical part of outline (main topics, subtopics, subsections)
   - level: h2 (main sections), h3/h4 (subsections, nested logically)
   - title: Clean, descriptive title
   - id: Unique string "sec-1", "sec-2", etc. (sequential)
   - **CRITICAL**: DO NOT include FAQ sections (e.g., "Frequently Asked Questions", "Preguntas Frecuentes", "FAQ") in body.sections. FAQ content must ONLY go in the "faq" field, never in body.sections.
   - lengthRange: [minWords, maxWords] - **EXTRACT EXACTLY from script**
     - Look for: "Estimated word count: X-Y words", "Word count: X-Y", "X-Y words"
     - If specified in script: use EXACTLY
     - If NOT specified: defaults are H2: 200-300, H3/H4: 150-250, Core: 400-500 max
     - DO NOT recalculate - script designer has planned this
   - description: Clear explanation of section content (guidelines for writer/AI). Include all planned points from script.
     **IMPORTANT**: If description contains image blocks (\`\`\`user-image or \`\`\`ai-image), extract to images array and remove block syntax from description
   - images (optional):
     - Extract image blocks from section description if present
     - For each \`\`\`user-image or \`\`\`ai-image block:
       - Extract: sourceType, sourceValue, title, description, alt
       - Remove block syntax from description
       - Add to images array
     - Image structure:
       - sourceType: "user" or "ai_generated" (from block or inferred from \`\`\`ai-image)
       - sourceValue (optional): from block or short identifier
       - title (optional): Short descriptive title for the image (from block or generate from description)
       - description (optional): AI prompt or user image context (detailed description for caption)
       - alt (optional): from block or generate SEO-friendly alt text
     - If no blocks found: leave images undefined/empty
   - requiresDeepResearch (optional): If you consider that the content of the section requires updated information, set this to true so the writer can search the facts in google. If that's the case, in the description, add a suggestion to the writer of what to search for.
   - links:
     - internal: Array of internal links in format \`[link text](slug-or-url)\` with description. Extract EXACTLY as written in the script. DON'T ADD INTERNAL LINKS IF IT'S NOT SPECIFIED IN THE SCRIPT. Example: \`[SEO best practices](/seo-guide) - Guide to SEO fundamentals\`
     - external: Array of external links in format \`[link text](full-url)\` with description. Extract EXACTLY as written in the script, including the full URL. DON'T ADD EXTERNAL LINKS IF IT'S NOT SPECIFIED IN THE SCRIPT. Example: \`[Google Search Central](https://developers.google.com/search) - Official Google SEO documentation\`
     - **CRITICAL**: Preserve the complete link format \`[link](url/description)\` exactly as specified in the script. Do NOT extract just the URL or just the description - keep the full markdown link format with description.

4. "faq" RULES
   - description: Clear explanation of FAQ content (guidelines for writer/AI). Include questions and answers (one line per Q&A)
   - lengthRange (optional): [minWords, maxWords] - extract from script if specified, otherwise undefined
   ${needsFaqSection ? '- FAQ section MUST be included if present in script' : '- FAQ section is optional'}
   - **CRITICAL**: If the script contains an FAQ section (e.g., "Frequently Asked Questions", "Preguntas Frecuentes", "FAQ"), extract its content into this "faq" field and REMOVE it from body.sections. FAQ sections should NEVER appear in body.sections.

${wordCountValidation}

5. STYLE & CONSISTENCY
   - Preserve original outline language
   - You may: complete unclear titles, group scattered points, add intro/conclusion if needed
   - Remove redundancies along sections to make sure every paragraph is unique and adds value to the content.
   - Ensure consistent hierarchy: h1 → h2 → h3 → h4
   - Research web when needed - include sources/details in descriptions (don't summarize, preserve full information for writer)

6. VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS
   - JSON must be valid: double quotes only, no trailing commas
   - Required fields: head.h1, head.introductionDescription, head.slug, head.tags, body.sections
   - Each section: id, level, title, lengthRange, description, links (internal + external)

  THIS IS A PRODUCTION SYSTEM, DO NOT ADD ANY COMMENTS, EXPLANATIONS, OR NOTES.
  DO NOT ADD MOCK TEXTS, DON'T MENTION FICTITIOUS BRANDS OR PRODUCTS.

**YOU MUST write EXACTLY ${lengthRange[0]} - ${lengthRange[1]} words total for the introduction.**

This is a HARD REQUIREMENT. Your response must be within this range:
- Minimum: ${lengthRange[0]} words
- Maximum: ${lengthRange[1]} words

The language of the introduction is ${lang}.

Count your words carefully. If your draft is too short, expand it with more detail, examples, or context. If it's too long, condense it while keeping all key points.
The word count is STRICTLY ENFORCED. Do not exceed or fall below these limits.

### Paragraph Word Count Rules (STRICTLY ENFORCED)
- **Standard paragraphs**: 40-80 words each
- **Critical paragraphs**: Up to 120 words maximum (only when absolutely necessary and highly readable)
- **Introduction structure**: Create multiple paragraphs (typically 3-8 paragraphs) to reach the introduction word count target
- **If content exceeds limits**: Split long paragraphs into multiple shorter ones

**How to structure the introduction:**
1. Break content into multiple paragraphs of 40-80 words each
2. Use 120-word paragraphs only for critical, complex explanations that cannot be split
3. Ensure the total word count of ALL paragraphs combined = ${lengthRange[0]} - ${lengthRange[1]} words
`
      : `
## Word Count Guidance
Aim for approximately 200-400 words for the introduction. Be comprehensive but concise.

### Paragraph Structure
- Create multiple paragraphs of 40-80 words each
- Use 120-word paragraphs only when absolutely necessary

${sectionGuidance}

### Paragraph Word Count Rules (STRICTLY ENFORCED)
- **Standard paragraphs**: 40-80 words each
- **Critical paragraphs**: Up to 120 words maximum (only when absolutely necessary and highly readable)
- **Section structure**: Create multiple paragraphs (typically 3-8 paragraphs) to reach the section word count target
- **If content exceeds limits**: Split long paragraphs or create subsections (H3/H4) with their own word counts

**How to structure the section:**
1. Break content into multiple paragraphs of 40-80 words each
2. Use 120-word paragraphs only for critical, complex explanations that cannot be split
3. Ensure the total word count of ALL paragraphs combined = ${section.lengthRange[0]} - ${section.lengthRange[1]} words
4. If the section needs more than 500 words total, indicate that it should be subdivided into H3/H4 subsections

**Output Format:**
Return ONLY a JSON object with this structure (no additional text):
{
  "blocks": [
    {
      "type": "paragraph",

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "Second paragraph (40-80 words)..."
    }
  ]

**Link Format in Content:**
- Internal links: Use markdown format [link text](internal link url) where the slug matches the internal link suggestion
- External links: Use markdown format [link text](https://full-url.com) with the actual URL from external link suggestions
- Links should be naturally integrated into the paragraph content, not added as separate sentences

NEVER ADD BACKTICKS, CODEBLOCK FENCES, OR FORMATTING CHARACTERS

**VALIDATION:**
- Total words across all blocks: ${section.lengthRange[0]} - ${section.lengthRange[1]} words
- Each paragraph: 40-80 words (up to 120 if critical)
